Hello! In this web application, I am using the Python framework Flask, along with implementing
third-party OAuth authentication. This project also displays the ability to properly use the various
HTTP methods available and how these methods relate to CRUD operations. By doing so, I will
efficiently be interacting with data at the backbone and properly implementing authentication
mechanisms.
